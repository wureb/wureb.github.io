cartoons are spirit-forms and the cartoonist is a kind of shaman. the cartoon form is manifested in the mind of its creator and communicated through drawing. once the cartoon form has been seen by another it is transmitted and now exists in the mind of said observer. the cartoon spirit-essence is then the same within creator and observer. this means that the cartoon cannot belong to even it’s creator; once created, the cartoon is a free-floating entity attaching itself parasitically to hosts. it cannot be intentionally destroyed. a cartoon-form exists until there is no mind to host it and then it ceases to exist on this plane.

to conjure a cartoon is to potentially create a Pepe, that which transcends you and transcends all morality/ becomes a symbol of any and everything (the whims of the subject), becomes used for whimsy and propaganda with no distinction. uncontrollable essence, spiritual chaos.

it is possible to render a cartoon visually but that visualization is not the thing itself. the cartoon-essence is a distinct form from any art-object depicting it. a cartoon could be presented in any medium and still retain its form/intent. The intent of a cartoon can be changed by anyone at any time. cartoons cannot be inherently imbued (by the creator) with a moral composition.
